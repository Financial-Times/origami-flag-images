## Usage

As with all image sets, these are available via the [Image Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2).

To get a flag from the Image Service, use the following URL (replace the `product_source` with your product name and `flag_name` with the ISO ALPHA-2 country code for the place you want)

`https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/flag:{flag_name}?source={product_source}`

So to get Japan:
`https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/flag:jp?source=test`

### Getting these flags in a different format/size

The Image Service will convert these images on the fly if you pass in the right parameters. To find out more about this, please see the [Image Service documentation](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/docs/api)

##Â Adding or modifying flags

To keep head-shots consistent, please follow these guidelines:

- Flags must be SVG format
- Flags must be in a 4:3 aspect ratio
- Flags must be named according to their ISO ALPHA-2 country
- Flag names must be lower case
	- **good**: jp.svg, gb.svg
	- **bad**: japan.svg, JP.svg, jp

**Please do not delete flags without talking to the Origami team who will need to manage the deprecation process**
